This pattern is desgined to provide the simple interface to the complex system of components.

The objects of the components need to be interacted with directly for complex task and scenarios. There are typical usages of the system and these complex tasks are not required for those common scenario. For such scenarios, we use Facade design pattern.

The facade design pattern allows us to create a new object that wraps these typical usage of the system.
